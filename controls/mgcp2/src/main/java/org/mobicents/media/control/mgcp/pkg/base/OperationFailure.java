/**
 * The operation failure event is generated when the endpoint was asked to apply one or several signals of type TO on the
 * endpoint or connection, and one or more of those signals failed prior to timing out.
 * <p>
 * The completion report should carry as a parameter the name of the signal that failed, as in: <br>
 * <br>
 * O: G/of(G/rt)<br>
 * <br>
 * In this case a failure occurred in producing the "rt" signal in the "G" package.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When the reported signal was applied on a connection, the parameter supplied will include the name of the connection as well,
 * as in: <br>
 * <br>
 * O: G/of(G/rt@0A3F58)<br>
 * <br>
 * When the operation failure event is requested, event parameters can not be specified. When the package name is omitted (which
 * is discouraged), the default package name is assumed.
