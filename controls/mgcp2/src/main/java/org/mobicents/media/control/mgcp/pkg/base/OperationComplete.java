/**
 * The operation complete event is generated when the gateway was asked to apply one or several signals of type TO on the
 * endpoint or connection, and one or more of those signals completed without being stopped by the detection of a requested
 * event such as off-hook transition or dialed digit.
 * <p>
 * The completion report should carry as a parameter the name of the signal that came to the end of its live time, as in: <br>
 * <br>
 * O: G/oc(G/rt)<br>
 * <br>
 * In this case, the observed event occurred because the "rt" signal in the "G" package timed out.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the reported signal was applied on a connection, the parameter supplied will include the name of the connection as well,
 * as in: <br>
 * <br>
 * O: G/oc(G/rt@0A3F58)<br>
 * <br>
 * When the operation complete event is requested, it cannot be parameterized with any event parameters.
